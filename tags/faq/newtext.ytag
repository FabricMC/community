type: text

---

Minecraft 1.19 changed how text components work. They are now created with methods on the `Text` interface instead of constructors of subclasses.

Here are the transformations for the basic text types:
`new LiteralText(...)` -> `Text.literal(...)`
`new TranslatableText(...)` -> `Text.translatable(...)`
`new KeybindText(...)` -> `Text.keybind(...)`
`new SelectorText(...)` -> `Text.selector(...)`
`new ScoreText(...)` -> `Text.score(...)`
`Text.EMPTY` -> `Text.empty()`

Nbt text was reworked largely. It's now one method (`Text.nbt(...)`) that takes a `NbtDataSource` as an argument. 
`NbtDataSource` has implementations  for all the different sources that were previously subclasses of `NbtText`.
