OptiFine doesn't support Fabric natively.

If you are willing to try alternatives, please look at this list:
<https://fabricmc.net/wiki/community:optifine_alternatives>

If, however, you really *really* want OptiFine, please know first OptiFine can cause heavy incompatibilities that are, in some cases, not easy to fix.

OptiFabric is a mod that allows OptiFine to run on Fabric but be aware that some mods will not bother to provide compatibility for it, so use it at your own risk:
