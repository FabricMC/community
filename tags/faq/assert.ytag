You should avoid using `assert` in your mod code. If the assert passes, it will work as expected. However, if it fails, or if assertions are disabled (default behavior), Minecraft will crash.
Instead of using the assertion pattern `assert someObject != null;`, you should use the null-checking pattern: `if (someObject != null) { /* Code here */ }
