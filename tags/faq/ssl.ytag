If you are getting a `SSLHandshakeException` when using the installer it usually means that something is messing with ssl certificates.

This is often caused by antiviruses, especailly **eset**, which intercept and scan incomming trafic. They often don't use proper cerificates when sending the data forward so they break a lot of apps (including fabric installer).

To fix this try these **in order**:
 1. Disable ssl filtering on your antivirus if possible.
 2. Disable the antivirus fully.
 3. Try using a VPN.
