Bots like PluralKit and /plu/ral replace messages with bot-based or webhook-based "pseudo-accounts."
This is useful for multiple people sharing more than one body (a.k.a. plural systems).
Due to Discord's limitations, these pseudo-accounts will appear with an `[APP]` tag, but these are not bots or apps.

**/plu/ral:** <https://plural.gg/>
