Scammers are targeting the Minecraft community with fake Fabric Discord servers. These people are **not** affiliated with Fabric! 

They have several common tactics, including vandalizing servers, spam-posting in online games and livestreams, and posting threatening messages in Dynmap chats. They mostly target offline-mode servers.

These scammers may ask you to log in or authenticate with your Microsoft account. **Don't do this!** They will steal your account.
