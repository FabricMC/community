Whilst LLMs (Large Language Models) like [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) and [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/) are impressive tools, **they are not recommended for first-time Fabric mod developers due to their inconsistency and potential for generating inaccurate code. **

LLMs may generate incorrect code that:

- Targets the wrong Minecraft version, leading to outdated or incompatible features.
- Uses incorrect mappings, causing errors or unexpected behavior.
- Is designed for the wrong loader (NeoForge vs. Fabric), resulting in incompatibility.
- Relies on non-existent Fabric API modules, creating code that references features that don't exist (called LLM hallucinations)

It's crucial to remember that LLMs should be seen as **problem-solving aids**, not code-generating machines. The output they provide often requires significant modification and understanding of Java before it can be implemented as a functional mod. 

**Therefore, learning Java is an absolute necessity before attempting to use any LLM-generated code in your mod.** Knowing how the generated code works is key to using it effectively and fixing any problems that may arise.
