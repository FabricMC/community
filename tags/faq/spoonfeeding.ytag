Spoon-feeding is giving somebody a full solution before that person has really put a full effort into solving the problem. Helping somebody along with examples and links to tutorials is not spoon-feeding, but giving them a complete code solution IS spoon-feeding.
Spoon-feeding doesn't help the person, it only hurts them. It robs them of the process of solving their problem by working through it. Problem solving is not only fun, it’s one of the fundamental skills required to be a good programmer, and it’s one of the hardest to teach.
To learn how to solve problems, you need to work through different kinds of problems, over and over again. Offering a full solution straight away doesn't let the person do this process, and that prevents them from becoming a good programmer.
A better option is to help the person work through the process by suggesting breaking the problem up into smaller pieces or thinking about how a human would solve the problem in their head or with a pencil and a piece of paper.
