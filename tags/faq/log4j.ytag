To protect from the critical Log4j RCE vulnerability (CVE-2021-44228), both the server owner and the users must take some actions.

**Fabric Servers**: 
Update to 1.18.1 if possible, or update Fabric Loader to 0.12.10.

**Fabric Clients**:
If you are using the official launcher or MultiMC, restarting the game and the launcher should be enough. If not, you can update the Fabric Loader version to 0.12.10.
