If you want to report inappropriate contents or otherwise need to contact a moderator:

1. Mention the <@&765938438989152266> role.
2. You can also send a direct message directly to a moderator if the problem is not urgent.

Please remember that all moderators are volunteers, and would prefer you don't use these options to contact them about bugs, questions, or support requests.
