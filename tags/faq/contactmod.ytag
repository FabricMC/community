If you want to report inappropriate contents or otherwise need to contact a moderator:

1. Mention the <@&765938438989152266> role.
2. If the problem concerns a member of staff, send a private message directly to a different member of staff.

Please remember that all moderators are volunteers, and would prefer you don't use these options to contact them about bugs, questions, or support requests.
