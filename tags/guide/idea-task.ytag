To fix what `./gradlew idea` did:
 - close the project in idea (File -> Close Project)
 - delete the .ipr, .iws, .iml files and the .idea directory
 - select "Import Project" in the IDEA main menu and select the build.gradle in your project
 - don't do `./gradlew idea` anymore, instead use the Reimport All Gradle Projects button in the Gradle tab inside of IDEA
