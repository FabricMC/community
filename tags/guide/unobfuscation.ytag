    title: Unobfuscation

---

Historically, Minecraft: Java Edition has made use of obfuscation, which led to the development of obfuscation maps that Fabric Loom uses for modding. There were two choices: either Fabric's own Yarn mappings, or the official Mojang mappings.

Mojang have recently announced [they're removing code obfuscation from Minecraft: Java Edition](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/removing-obfuscation-in-java-edition), and the Fabric Project followed up with [its plan for handling this change](https://fabricmc.net/2025/10/31/obfuscation.html). If you plan to update your mod to this version, you will need to move to Mojang's obfuscation mappings first before updating. All new mods now default to Mojang Mappings.

All Fabric projects, including [Fabric API](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric/pull/4960), [Fabric Loader](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loader/pull/1095), [Fabric Loom](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-loom/issues/1422), and the [Fabric Docs](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-docs/pull/391) are currently being migrated from Yarn to Mojang Mappings and the new unobfuscated game. Please be patient during this transition period, and make use of tools like [mappings.dev](https://mappings.dev/), [Linkie](https://linkie.shedaniel.dev/mappings?namespace=yarn&translateMode=ns&translateAs=mojang_raw&search=), [Ravel](https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/migrating-mappings/ravel), and [Loom's migrateMappings](https://docs.fabricmc.net/develop/migrating-mappings/loom) as we transition into this new era of modding.
