If you're getting `org.spongepowered.asm.mixin.transformer.throwables.InvalidMixinException: @Shadow field field_9391 was not located in the target class net.minecraft.world.biome.source.BiomeSource` when updated from 1.16.1:

  1. exclude fabric api from all your dependencies
  2. run gradle with the `--refresh-dependencies` flag
