Because `ClientPlayNetworkHandler#onEntitySpawn` hardcodes all the entities that don't inherit from `LivingEntity` you must make your own packet
You can look at `EntitySpawnS2CPacket` for what your packet should do and register it with `ClientSidePacketRegistry`. then all you need to do is override `CreateSpawnPacket` on your Entity with your new packet
