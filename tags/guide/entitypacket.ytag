Anything inheriting directly from `Entity` must:
1) Create a custom entity spawn packet for overriding `Entity.createSpawnPacket`, because `ClientPlayNetworkHandler.onEntitySpawn` is hardcoded to only support vanilla Non-LivingEntity
or
2) Inject into `ClientPlayerNetworkHandler.onEntitySpawn` and do handle the packet there.
