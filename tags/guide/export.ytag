Exporting your mod as a JAR file: Run in a terminal from the same directory as the mod project directory:
`./gradlew build` on GNU/Linux and macOS, or `gradlew.bat build` on Windows (`.\gradlew.bat build` in PowerShell).
Alternatively, in IntelliJ IDEA, open the Gradle tab on the right and execute `build` under tasks. The JARs should appear in `${projectDir}/build/libs`.
Use the one with the shortest name outside development.
