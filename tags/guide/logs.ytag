    title: How to post your logs to get help

---

For support with crashes or other errors, provide the relevant logs:

Logs: Located in the `logs` folder in your game directory. The latest log is a text file called `latest` or `latest.log`.
Crash reports: Located in the `crash-reports` folder in your game directory. If generated, share the newest one.

To make it easier for others to read, do not copy-and-paste, screenshot, or significantly alter your logs. 
Upload logs to a paste site and share the link so others do not have to download it. Type `!!paste` for a list of sites.
