  title: Using a Paste Site

---

When sharing a large piece of code or a log, you should use a paste site instead of uploading a file or dumping it in a large codeblock.
Dumping your code/log in a code block or a message can make it difficult for other people to read previous messages.

**Paste sites and their size limits:**

**»** [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/): 100 MiB / Requires membership
**»** [Paste.gg](https://paste.gg/): 15 MiB / Optional membership
**»** [Paste.ee](https://paste.ee/): 1 MiB / Optional membership (raises limit to 6 MiB)
**»** [Pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/): 512 KiB / Optional membership
**»** [Hastebin.com](https://hastebin.com/): 400 KiB / Anonymous
