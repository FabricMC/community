  title: Using a Paste Site

---

When sharing long code or logs, it's best to upload it to a paste site and share the link. 
This way, others don't have to download the file to read it, and it's easier to read previous messages. 

**Paste sites and their size limits:**

**»** [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/): 100 MiB / Requires an account
**»** [Paste.gg](https://paste.gg/): 15 MiB / Account is optional
**»** [Mclo.gs](https://mclo.gs/): 10 MiB / Anonymous (designed specifically for Minecraft logs)
**»** [Paste.ee](https://paste.ee/): 1 MiB / Account is optional (raises limit to 6 MiB)
**»** [Pastebin.com](https://pastebin.com/): 512 KiB / Account is optional
**»** [Hastebin.com](https://hastebin.com/): 400 KiB / Anonymous
