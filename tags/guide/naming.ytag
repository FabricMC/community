Classes should be named with the first letter of each word capitalized, like this: `ThisIsAClass`
`static final` fields should be named in all caps, with underscores between each word, like this: `THIS_IS_STATIC_FINAL`
Everything else (methods, variables, etc) should be named with the first letter of each word capitalized, but with the first letter lowercase, like this: `thisIsEverythingElse`
Naming things like this in Java helps other people to understand your code more quickly.
