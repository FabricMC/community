    title: Mod Menu

---

Fabric doesn't come with a mod menu built-in. There's a mod called Mod Menu that adds it. 
You can download it from [Modrinth](https://modrinth.com/mod/modmenu).
Some mods integrate with Mod Menu and add in-game configuration screens.
Click on the "Mods" button and select the mod you want to configure; if the mod integrates with Mod Menu, you'll see a "Settings" button on the top-right.
