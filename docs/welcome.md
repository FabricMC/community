Welcome to the Fabric project's community Discord server!

**__What is the Fabric project?__**

The Fabric project is a modular and modern modding toolchain for Minecraft, primarily targeting 1.14+ versions of the game. It aims to provide an efficient and easy-to-use toolset for creating Minecraft mods, with a short time-to-release when a new version of Minecraft comes out. It's also based on Yarn, which is a fully free/open set of Minecraft mappings.

**__Rules__**

1️⃣ Follow Discord's Terms of Service and Community Guidelines
2️⃣ Use English if possible
3️⃣ Treat all users with patience and respect, and consider other people's personal circumstances (e.g. epilepsy, identity, plurality, PTSD, culture, race, sexuality, etc)
4️⃣ Communicate in an appropriate and non-discriminatory manner, and don't provoke or harass others
5️⃣ Don't mention (aka ping) other users to draw attention to your support requests, or to be hostile/annoying
6️⃣ Keep all projects legal and appropriate, and follow licensing requirements — for example, no piracy, malware or troll projects, and all code examples must avoid sexual and discriminatory language
7️⃣ Follow the given topics and guidelines for each channel
8️⃣ Do not mention names from MCP, Mojang or other proprietary mappings, even if you use spoilers
9️⃣ Listen to and cooperate with the staff team

**Remember:** Try to be constructive in your criticism of other projects. Detailed opinions and reasoning is good, "[project] bad/cursed" is not. In the same vein, don't spam other communities or people in Fabric's name and don't bug or harass anyone about "converting" to Fabric — this just reflects poorly on both you and the Fabric community as a whole.

**Please note:** We try to judge each situation to the best of our ability, given the context available. That said, the enforcement of our rules is at the individual discretion of each moderator, and we reserve the right to remove any content posted, for any reason.

Additionally, we reserve the right to take action against people that try to bend or skirt the rules (that is to say, people that violate the spirit of the rules rather than the word). We may also take stronger corrective actions towards people that have multiple smaller infractions, regardless of their severity.

For further information on these rules and why we decided on them, please see: **<link to expanded document on GitHub>**
Our ruleset reflects our Code of Conduct, which you can find here: **<link to CoC on GitHub>**

From time to time, our rules (and other policies) may be updated — we'll let you know with a message in #moderator-messages and give you a chance to provide feedback before the changes are put in place. However, users are still responsible for keeping themselves up-to-date and avoid breaking the rules (or other policies) after they've been updated.

We also reserve the right to make emergency changes to policies quickly, if needed. In those cases, we may gather less feedback before applying a policy update.

**__Reporting a Problem__**

If something happens that requires the attention of a staff member (e.g. someone spams or otherwise breaks the rules), then you have a few options:

**»** For issues you'd rather keep private, send a private message to **<@ Fabric Mod Mail>** to open a modmail thread and a staff member will respond as soon as possible.
**»** For issues that are unfolding in public, feel free to mention (aka ping) the **<@ Moderator>** role directly in the channel — but, of course, you can still use modmail if you'd prefer.
**»** If your report concerns a member of staff, please send a private message directly to a different member of staff.

Please don't be afraid to contact the staff if there's a problem — we're not going to be upset if you ping/mention us, even if we decide that no action is appropriate. That said, please don't try to direct the attention of the staff team to a support-related issue (for example: mod installation, Fabric crashes or mod development help) — we have specific channels for that.

**__Channels__**

We have a wide variety, and you can read the description for any channel to find out what it's for. We'd like to point out that none of our channels are for dumping memes — this is especially poignant in the general channels, where people may be discussing something and don't wish to be disrupted by large, out-of-context images. Additionally, we'd like to draw your attention to several showcase-style channels in this community — please note that they all have a separate discussion channel:

**»** <#725837054092771368>, <#507982666755473427> and <#523251999899385875> are for your newly-released, updated and work-in-progress projects respectively, and all discussion should happen in <#511324119728521285>.
**»** <#556200510592647168> is for serious (non-joke) mod ideas and suggestions, and discussion should happen in <#576536198823018498>.

For further information on what each channel is and what you can post there, please see: **<link to channel guide on GitHub>**

**__Social Guidelines__**

To make sure that everyone has the best experience they can here, we ask everyone to read the below guidelines and follow them. While these aren't rules, following them will help everyone to have a positive experience when taking part in our community.

**General Guidelines**

**»** Try your best to be respectful and composed. Be constructive with your criticisms, and don't intentionally upset people. When providing negative feedback, attack concepts rather than people.
**»** If you're getting heated and your discussions are becoming unproductive, consider stepping away from Discord until you feel better and can think more clearly.
**»** All voices are welcome, regardless of age, identity or level of experience — try to be helpful and encouraging towards newcomers and those that need help, and don't make fun of them for knowing less than you do. 
**»** Be mindful of how you communicate — not everyone has the same linguistic/cultural background as you, and you should try to make sure people don't misunderstand you (for example, be careful with sarcasm).
**»** Similarly, consider the words you use. Remember that there are a lot of problematic terms out there, and some cultures may be less accepting of something that's been normalized in your culture. Many examples of this exist in negative terms — for example, if you're trying to express that you feel that a piece of code you wrote is stupid, don't use the word `retarded`.
**»** Remember that everyone has a life as interesting, rich and varied as your own, and these experiences will shape everyone differently — if someone asks you to stop behaving in a certain way, you should listen to them (especially if it directly involves them).
**»** Avoid being disruptive — don't post memes without relevance to the current discussion, don't dump images, code blocks or other media in the middle of someone else's conversation, and don't try to interrupt discussions or force them onto another topic. Our general channels are not for shitposts. There are many places on Discord that are designed for you to dump memes, shitposts and images — this isn't one of them.

**Support Guidelines**

**»** Don't ask to ask — just ask! Instead of asking for someone to help, state your problem directly; this makes it more likely for people to engage in conversation and try to help you. See: <http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html>
**»** When asking a development question, it is wise to give others context from the get-go. If you're trying to do Y to achieve X, it is more helpful to us to ask "I want to achieve X, is Y the best way to do it — and if so, how should I do it?" rather than just "How do I do Y?". See: <http://xyproblem.info/>
**»** If someone has just asked a question or there's an active support session going on, please consider waiting a little while before posting your question. Nobody likes having their questions buried, or having their discussions disrupted with large blocks of code.
**»** Don't be afraid to help out if you see someone in need of support. We were all beginners once upon a time, and everyone benefits from working together on problems.
