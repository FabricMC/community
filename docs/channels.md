# Channel Guide

The Fabric Discord server (Fabricord) is a relatively large community, containing a wide variety of channels — mostly relating directly to Fabric, but also including a lively off-topic community. This document serves as a run-down of all of our channels, and how they're intended to be used.

We also include channel descriptions directly on Discord — please read them.

## Information Category

This category contains informational channels, providing important information on the Fabric project and its community, as well as information on Fabric and Minecraft updates and official communications from moderators. Users may not send messages in these channels — they're read-only.

* `#tiny-potato`:

* `#welcome`: The primary Discord information channel and the one you should be familiar with. This channel contains information on how the community is run, how we expect you to behave, and what you can do if there's a problem.

* `#announcements`: New Minecraft releases and important Fabric news is announced in this channel.

* `#live-update-updates`: Information on the Fabric update process and how it adjusts to Minecraft updates is posted here, along with information we dig up during that process.

* `#moderator-messages`: Important communications from the moderation team, directed at the community as a whole. We suggest you avoid muting this channel, for the sake of staying up to date on community policies and not being caught out by changes.

## Showcase Category

This category is where you go to show off your Fabric-related projects. Please note that this category has only one discussion channel — the others should not be used for conversation.

All projects posted in these channels need to be related to Fabric somehow — for example: mods and libraries, or services for Fabric users.

* `#new-releases`: You can post about the initial public release of your new projects here. We'll also allow posts for the first public release of a completely reworked project.

* `#update-releases`: You can post when you release an update to a project that's already been released. Do not post newly-released projects here.

* `#showcase`: This channel can be used to showcase the things you're working on - for example, a new feature you've added to a mod. As many members of our community are not programmers, we ask that you post in-game screenshots and videos where possible instead of code — although we do recognise that some projects can only be showcased through code. This channel is a forum, thus appropriate discussion may take place in forum threads. Please keep discussion on topic to the original showcase.

* `#epic-fails`: A place to share funny bugs, crazy rendering glitches and other noteworthy depictions of something going wrong with Fabric modding. Posts should be primarily visual content with minimal explanation.

* `#showcase-discussion`: Use this channel to discuss anything that's been posted in `#new-releases`, `#update-releases` or `#epic-fails`. Please note that **this is not an off-topic channel** — we have one of those in the community category if you wish to talk about something else.

## Community Category

* `#minecraft`: A place to discuss topics related to Minecraft beyond the scope of anything related to Fabric mod authoring and direct use. Please do not use this channel for mod requests or support requests. 

* `#programming`: This channel can be used to discuss programming outside of Fabric modding, or anything too technically inclined for the current conversation in `#general`. This channel is not for any form of technical or player support related to modding. See `#player-support` or the Mod Development Category

* `#player-support`: This is where you go if your game is crashing with Fabric installed — you can ask about help with specific mods, with Fabric itself, or just to try and figure out why your game isn't working.

* `#server-admin-support`: A place for server admins to request help with technical problems encountered while curating a Fabric server.

* `#general`: Our off-topic community hangs out in this channel. This is a **discussion channel**, which means that **it is not meant for dumping images, videos, memes, shitposts or other media** (although you can post media if it actually contributes to the current discussion, or is intended to start a new one). Please read the channel before you post, and try not to disrupt an ongoing conversation.

* `#requests`: Use this channel to request ideas for new mods. Please note that **this channel is only suitable for serious requests**, not shitposts or jokes. This channel is a forum, thus appropriate discussion may take place in forum threads. Please keep discussion on topic to the original request.

* `#discord-meta`: This is a strictly on-topic channel for users to ask about the community and raise issues with the staff team in a public space. This is a heavily-moderated channel and you should be on your best behaviour when making use of it.

  Additionally, this is not a project-relevant channel — it only concerns the community. Please keep your development-related questions to the fabric development category.

  Please do not use this channel to report problems to the moderators — mention/ping the `@Moderators` role wherever the problem is happening, or send a private message to `@Fabric Mod Mail` to open a modmail thread with the staff team.

## Mod Development Category

This category contains channels that you can use when you need help with your mods. Please ensure that you give as much information as possible — "it's not working" isn't enough information for us to help you.

* `#mod-dev`: A forum style general mod development help channel best suited for sustained, focused support or long running queries. It can make sense to move to this channel from other channels if a long pause in support it required if you choose to open a thread here after requesting help elsewhere, please link all prior discussions from other channels so that others can not waste time on things already covered. Please do not open a thread in this channel and spam the link in other channels. Other modders will respond in your thread if they are willing to help. Please keep discussion on topic to the original post.

* `#mod-dev-1` and `#mod-dev-2`: These channels may be used for general development support when working on a mod. There are multiple channels to enable multiple help sessions to happen at the same time, so please read the channel before posting and don't talk over or bury another active help session.

  Additionally, pick one channel and stick with it — don't post your question in more than one channel. It's also worth remembering that everyone that helps out in these channels is working on a voluntary basis, and there may not be someone available to help when you post your question.
  
  If you feel that your question is being ignored, it's likely that nobody is around that knows how to help you. In this case, just wait a while and try again later.

* `#mod-dev-kotlin`: If your mod is being written in Kotlin, you can seek Kotlin-specific help with it in this channel. Please note that this channel is only suitable for Kotlin-specific questions, and you should use one of the regular `mod-dev` channels if a Java developer is likely to be able to help you.

* `#mod-dev-mixin`: Discussion and support for the [SpongePowered Mixin](https://github.com/FabricMC/Mixin) library as used in Fabric mods, and it's related extension libraries. Ask questions, share insights, and troubleshoot issues with mixins. Remember to keep questions focused on Mixin usage  (not general Java/Fabric topics) and show relevant code snippets and error logs when asking for help.

* `#mod-dev-rendering`: A place to discuss rendering in Fabric mods. 

* `#mod-dev-worldgen`: A place to discuss Minecraft worldgen as it relates to fabric modding. when asking for help please be sure to share any relevant json files, as well as any code you may have written. be sure to describe your problem thoroughly to enable efficient asynchronous communication.

* `#dev-talk`: Discussion of fabric modding, by modders. This channel is not for support, please use other channels for support.

* `#bot-posting`: This is our bot commands channel and you should make use of it when you're working with the community bots, where possible. Use this channel instead of creating spam in other channels, as bot use can significantly disrupt the flow of a channel.

When asking for support, it's important to approach your issue in the right manner. You can use the below tips as a guideline — you'll also find them in the Social Guidelines category of `#welcome`:

* Don't ask to ask — just ask! Instead of asking for someone to help, state your problem directly; this makes it more likely for people to engage in conversation and try to help you. See: http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html

* When asking a development question, it is wise to give others context from the get-go. If you're trying to do Y to achieve X, it is more helpful to us to ask "I want to achieve X, is Y the best way to do it — and if so, how should I do it?" rather than just "How do I do Y?". See: http://xyproblem.info/

* If someone has just asked a question or there's an active support session going on, please consider waiting a little while before posting your question. Nobody likes having their questions buried, or having their discussions disrupted with large blocks of code.

* Don't be afraid to help out if you see someone in need of support. We were all beginners once upon a time, and everyone benefits from working together on problems.

## Fabric's Own Development Category

This category contains a set of **strictly on-topic channels** that directly relate to the development of the Fabric project itself, and its many moving parts. Most of the channels here relate to a specific sub-project in the Fabric ecosystem, so those channels have been intentionally left out of this list.

* `#last-call`: This channel is updated with completed pull requests, to give people a last chance to object to them or otherwise provide feedback before they get merged. Please use the pull requests themselves for any additional discussion.

* `#toolchain-other`: You can use this channel to discuss the development of any Fabric sub-project that doesn't have a channel in this category.

* `#api`: Discussion for the development of the official Fabric modding API. Please use other channels if you need support.

* `#yarn`: Development of Yarn mappings. Do not mention other mappings in this channel.

* `#docs`: Discussion for the official Fabric Documentation. This channel is not a support channel.

* `#wiki`: Use this channel to request editor access to the wiki, or to discuss changes or improvements to the wiki itself or the articles posted on it.

* `#github`: This is a channel that is automatically updated whenever something happens on GitHub.

## Voice Category

This category contains all of our public voice channels — you can go here to voice- or video-chat with other members of the community, or to stream your work.

**Please note:** All streams must be appropriate for the community, and strictly safe-for-work. We also ask that users do not disrupt the conversations happening within the voice channels using music, mic-spamming, sound-boards or any other disruptive tools or techniques.

* `general`: This is an off-topic voice channel. Remember that our rules apply to all communications on the server, including this channel!

* `dev-talk`: This channel is an on-topic channel for discussing Fabric-related development. If you're on voice to talk shop, we'd prefer that you used this channel instead of the `general` channel.
