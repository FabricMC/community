# Channel Guide

The Fabric Discord server (Fabricord) is a relatively large community, containing a wide variety of channels — mostly relating directly to Fabric, but also including a lively off-topic community. This document serves as a run-down of all of our channels, and how they're intended to be used.

We also include channel descriptions directly on Discord — please read them.

## Information Category

This category contains informational channels, providing important information on the Fabric project and its community, as well as information on Fabric and Minecraft updates and official communications from moderators. Users may not send messages in these channels — they're read-only.

* `#tiny-potato`:

* `#welcome`: The primary Discord information channel and the one you should be familiar with. This channel contains information on how the community is run, how we expect you to behave, and what you can do if there's a problem.

* `#announcements`: New Minecraft releases and important Fabric news is announced in this channel.

* `#live-update-updates`: Information on the Fabric update process and how it adjusts to Minecraft updates is posted here, along with information we dig up during that process.

* `#moderator-messages`: Important communications from the moderation team, directed at the community as a whole. We suggest you avoid muting this channel, for the sake of staying up to date on community policies and not being caught out by changes.

## Showcase Category

This category is where you go to show off your Fabric-related projects. Please note that this category has only one discussion channel — the others should not be used for conversation.

All projects posted in these channels need to be related to Fabric somehow — for example: mods and libraries, or services for Fabric users.

* `#new-releases`: You can post about the initial public release of your new projects here. We'll also allow posts for the first public release of a completely reworked project.

* `#update-releases`: You can post when you release an update to a project that's already been released. Do not post newly-released projects here.

* `#showcase`: This channel can be used to showcase the things you're working on - for example, a new feature you've added to a mod. As many members of our community are not programmers, we ask that you post in-game screenshots and videos where possible instead of code — although we do recognise that some projects can only be showcased through code.

* `#showcase-discussion`: Use this channel to discuss anything that's been posted in any of the other three channels. Please note that **this is not an off-topic channel** — we have more than one of those in the community category if you wish to talk about something else.

## Community Category

* `#player-general`: This channel is a space to talk about Fabric as a player, as well as somewhere you can talk about Fabric mods and modpacks. It's also suitable for discussions based around server administration, hosting and working with the JVM, as well as looking-for-group style posts by people that are looking for somewhere to play. This is not a space for developers — see the mod development category for that.

* `#player-support`: This is where you go if your game is crashing with Fabric installed — you can ask about help with specific mods, with Fabric itself, or just to try and figure out why your game isn't working.

* `#general-discussion` & `#general-discussion-2`: Our off-topic community hangs out in these channels. These are **discussion channels**, which means that **they are not meant for dumping images, videos, memes, shitposts or other media** (although you can post media if it actually contributes to the current discussion, or is intended to start a new one). Please read the channel before you post, and try not to disrupt an ongoing conversation — if one of the channels is busy, you can always try the other one.

* `#requests`: Use this channel to request ideas for new mods. Please note that **this channel is only suitable for serious requests**, not shitposts or jokes. Additionally, this channel is not meant for discussion — use `#requests-discussion` for that.

* `#requests-discussion`: The place to go when you want to discuss a post in `#requests`. Please note that **this is not an off-topic channel** — we have more than one of those in the community category if you wish to talk about something else.

* `#discord-meta`: This is a strictly on-topic channel for users to ask about the community and raise issues with the staff team in a public space. This is a heavily-moderated channel and you should be on your best behaviour when making use of it.

  Additionally, this is not a project-relevant channel — it only concerns the community. Please keep your development-related questions to the fabric development category.

  Please do not use this channel to report problems to the moderators — mention/ping the `@Moderators` role wherever the problem is happening, or send a private message to `@Fabric Mod Mail` to open a modmail thread with the staff team.

## Mod Development Category

This category contains channels that you can use when you need help with your mods. Please ensure that you give as much information as possible — "it's not working" isn't enough information for us to help you.

* `#mod-dev-1`, `#mod-dev-2` & `#mod-dev-3`: These channels may be used for general development support when working on a mod. There are multiple channels to enable multiple help sessions to happen at the same time, so please read the channel before posting and don't talk over or bury another active help session.

  Additionally, pick one channel and stick with it — don't post your question in more than one channel. It's also worth remembering that everyone that helps out in these channels is working on a voluntary basis, and there may not be someone available to help when you post your question.
  
  If you feel that your question is being ignored, it's likely that nobody is around that knows how to help you. In this case, just wait a while and try again later.

* `#mod-dev-kotlin`: If your mod is being written in Kotlin, you can seek Kotlin-specific help with it in this channel. Please note that this channel is only suitable for Kotlin-specific questions, and you should use one of the regular `mod-dev` channels if a Java developer is likely to be able to help you.

* `#bot-posting`: This is our bot commands channel and you should make use of it when you're working with the community bots, where possible. Use this channel instead of creating spam in other channels, as bot use can significantly disrupt the flow of a channel.

When asking for support, it's important to approach your issue in the right manner. You can use the below tips as a guideline — you'll also find them in the Social Guidelines category of `#welcome`:

* Don't ask to ask — just ask! Instead of asking for someone to help, state your problem directly; this makes it more likely for people to engage in conversation and try to help you. See: http://sol.gfxile.net/dontask.html

* When asking a development question, it is wise to give others context from the get-go. If you're trying to do Y to achieve X, it is more helpful to us to ask "I want to achieve X, is Y the best way to do it — and if so, how should I do it?" rather than just "How do I do Y?". See: http://xyproblem.info/

* If someone has just asked a question or there's an active support session going on, please consider waiting a little while before posting your question. Nobody likes having their questions buried, or having their discussions disrupted with large blocks of code.

* Don't be afraid to help out if you see someone in need of support. We were all beginners once upon a time, and everyone benefits from working together on problems.

## Fabric's Own Development Category

This category contains a set of **strictly on-topic channels** that directly relate to the development of the Fabric project itself, and its many moving parts. Most of the channels here relate to a specific sub-project in the Fabric ecosystem, so those channels have been intentionally left out of this list.

* `#last-call`: This channel is updated with completed pull requests, to give people a last chance to object to them or otherwise provide feedback before they get merged. Please use the pull requests themselves for any additional discussion.

* `#toolchain-other`: You can use this channel to discuss the development of any Fabric sub-project that doesn't have a channel in this category.

* `#wiki`: Use this channel to request editor access to the wiki, or to discuss changes or improvements to the wiki itself or the articles posted on it.

* `#github`: This is a channel that is automatically updated whenever something happens on GitHub.

## Voice Category

This category contains all of our public voice channels — you can go here to voice- or video-chat with other members of the community, or to stream your work.

**Please note:** All streams must be appropriate for the community, and strictly safe-for-work. We also ask that users do not disrupt the conversations happening within the voice channels using music, mic-spamming, sound-boards or any other disruptive tools or techniques.

* `#voice-chat`: This channel can be used to participate in conversations happening within the voice channels, regardless of whether you have (or wish to use) a microphone — or if you just want to share links and other media with other people on voice.

  This is not a general discussion channel, however — it's only for use alongside the voice channels.

* `general`: This is an off-topic voice channel. Remember that our rules apply to all communications on the server, including this channel!

* `dev-talk`: This channel is an on-topic channel for discussing Fabric-related development. If you're on voice to talk shop, we'd prefer that you used this channel instead of the `general` channel.
