# Fabric Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, culture, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.

## Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

* Being kind and courteous to others
* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Collaborating with other community members
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

## Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and sexual attention or advances
* The use of inappropriate images, including in a community member's avatar
* The use of inappropriate language, including in a community member's nickname or status
* Any spamming, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behavior
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
* Discussing topics that are overly polarizing, sensitive, or incite heated arguments. This includes the discussion of polarizing political views, violence, suicide, and rape
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

# Our goal

The goal of this document is to set the overall tone for our community. This isn’t an exhaustive list of things you can and can't do — because of this, there will be behaviours not explicitly mentioned in this Code of Conduct (and our rules) that will be considered unacceptable. Rather, take this document in the spirit in which it’s intended, and try to be your best self.

We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply providing the correct answer.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all spaces managed by Fabric. This includes, but is not limited to: the Discord server, our repositories on GitHub and any potential meet-ups. In addition, non-minor violations of this code outside these spaces may affect a person's ability to participate within them.

The Fabric Code of Conduct applies equally to all members of the community, including staff.

# Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the Fabric staff members, either directly on Discord or via the modmail bot. If your report concerns a specific staff member or group of staff members, please send your report to a staff member that is not part of the report.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly, and all staff members are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporters of any incident. 

# Changes

From time to time, our Code of Conduct (and other policies) may be updated — we'll let you know with a message in `#moderator-messages` on Discord and give you a chance to provide feedback before the changes are put in place. However, users are still responsible for keeping themselves up-to-date and avoid breaking the Code of Conduct (or other policies) after they've been updated.

We also reserve the right to make emergency changes to policies quickly, if needed. In those cases, we may gather less feedback before applying a policy update.
