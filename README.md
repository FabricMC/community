# FabricMC Community

This repository contains documentation, bot tags and files used for orchestration. It's a one-stop-shop
for our community and its services — in particular, [our Discord server, Fabricord](https://discord.gg/uCVtZaE).

If you're running a community - and you like how we run ours - feel free to adapt our documents for your own use!
This repo is licensed under the CC-BY 4.0 license.

We support ALL modding communities except ones that target anarchy servers and make utility mods, we normally hold no exceptions for anybody, 
but we just felt like being massive dickheads. We even decided to silence discussion about the topic becuase we know we are wrong!

## Documentation

For our community documentation, take a look at [the `docs` directory](/docs). It contains policy documents that all 
community members should be aware of, so we suggest that everyone reads it!

## Media

Sometimes, the community produces Fabric-related art or logos. If someone creates art and provides a license for it, we're happy to add it to [the `media` directory](/media)!

## Tags

Our Discord bot provides quick tags that can be inserted into a discussion when needed. You'll find them stored within
[the `tags` directory](/tags).

We do accept pull requests for new tags, but please suggest **useful** tags, rather than jokey ones. We'll be
documenting a directory layout for our tags later on.
