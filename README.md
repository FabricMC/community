# FabricMC Community

This repository contains documentation, bot tags and files used for orchestration. It's intended to be a one-stop-shop for our community and its services â€” in particular, Fabricord.

If you're running a community and you like how we run ours, feel free to adapt our documents for your own use!

## Documentation

For our community documentation, take a look at [the `docs` directory](/docs). It contains policy documents that all community members should be aware of, so we suggest that everyone reads it!
