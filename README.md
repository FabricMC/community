# FabricMC Community

This repository contains documentation, bot tags and files used for orchestration. It's a one-stop-shop
for our community and its services â€” in particular, [our Discord server, Fabricord](https://discord.gg/uCVtZaE).

If you're running a community - and you like how we run ours - feel free to adapt our documents for your own use!

## Documentation

For our community documentation, take a look at [the `docs` directory](/docs). It contains policy documents that all 
community members should be aware of, so we suggest that everyone reads it!

## Media

Sometimes, the community produces Fabric-related art or logos. If someone creates art and provides a license for it, we're happy to add it to [the `media` directory](/media)!

## Tags

Our Discord bot provides quick tags that can be inserted into a discussion when needed. You'll find them stored within
[the `tags` directory](/tags).

We do accept pull requests for new tags, but please suggest **useful** tags, rather than jokey ones. We'll be
documenting a directory layout for our tags later on.
